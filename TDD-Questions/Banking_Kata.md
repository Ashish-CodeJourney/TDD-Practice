# Banking Kata

## Overview
Create a simple bank application with features for depositing, withdrawing, and printing account statements.

## Constraints

1. Start with a class with the following structure:

    ```java
    public class Account {
      public void deposit(int amount)
      public void withdraw(int amount)
      public void printStatement()
    }
    ```

2. You are not allowed to add any other public methods in this class.

3. Use Strings and Integers for dates and amounts to keep it simple.

4. Donâ€™t worry about the spacing in the statement printed in the console.

## Requirements

1. **Deposit into Account**

    - Example Input: 
      - `deposit(1000)` on "01/04/2014"
      - `deposit(500)` on "10/04/2014"
    - Example Output:
      - Account balance after the deposits: 1500.00

2. **Withdraw from an Account**

    - Example Input: 
      - `withdraw(100)` on "02/04/2014"
    - Example Output:
      - Account balance after the withdrawal: 1400.00

3. **Print the Account statement to the console**

    - Example Input:
      - After the operations above.
    - Example Output:
    
      ```
      DATE       | AMOUNT  | BALANCE
      10/04/2014 | 500.00  | 1400.00
      02/04/2014 | -100.00 | 900.00
      01/04/2014 | 1000.00 | 1000.00
      ```

## Implementation Using Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Step 1: Write Test Cases

Before implementing the functionality, write test cases to ensure that the functions work as expected. Use a testing framework to create the tests.

### Step 2: Implement the Functions

Next, implement the `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `printStatement` methods in the `Account` class to pass the tests.

### Step 3: Run the Tests

Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass. If any test fails, revise the functions until all tests pass.
